# MANI’S MAGAZINE 

### Application Development LifeCycle

---

> The current project has come to a conclusion where the Database logical models have finally come to their physical state and data has been added to it for the customer. I.e. For Mani’s Magazine. 
The database project for the Magazine store has been complete tested and verified for all its validations and now can be successfully implemented on the production environment and good to use

---

### Design Phase of Application

> For this phase of the project I have fully designed the data tables ( entities ) that were required during your preliminary investigation into the application. Defined all datatypes and key fields.  When completing table structures focus was on application scalability.

---

### Loading the Tables with Valid data

> In this phase dummy data was populated in all the tabele with valid data type.  

---

### Testing Database System

> Exposing any integrity issues, any insert, delete and / or update anomalies is one of the goals of this phase.  Discovering any faults is an important part of this project.  We want to ensure a properly running application, prior to its full implement.  

> Fully tested table entities individually and against each other by designing ten database queries.  Maked use of simple and complex joins and subqueries between your tables.  Used both valid and invalid data to perform test queries.

> Fully labeled the purpose and action of individual queries.  Performed queries such as adding a new customer, issuing a purchase refund, changing a product number that appears within a table, etc.  Maked good use of typical database clauses: WHERE, HAVING, GROUP BY

### Performing Data Analytics on the data base

> This phase of the project gives attention to data decisions issues.  Examined the tables from a statistical perspective as to what inferential information can be drawn from the application.  Performed aggregated statistical queries involving measures of central tendency ( averages ) , measures of dispersion ( variances and standard deviations ) and measures of position ( quartiles and buckets ) .

> Generate graphs, charts and reports based on your table data.  Included at pie and bar graph charts

> Also use linear regression technique was used to detect any linear patterns in one or more of the data tables.

---

# Web Presence

> In this phase we designing and implementing a Web application that collects data and performs data analytics on an MS Access database file that is associated with perhaps one new tables.

> Basically used some starter files provided with this project, modify them and then perform various data analytical routines on the table data.
